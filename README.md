#### Alongside the Sparkz Engine, this visualizer has been the second most fun coding project I've worked on, and I've learned a ton! I'm happy to be able to share this with you all! Thank you to everyone who has and continues to support me and all of my projects!

## Working with the Source

---

What you'll need to build and run from the source code
```
Java JDK 8 + Java JRE 8 + IntelliJ + Kotlin
```
#### The project is an IntelliJ IDEA project so I'd recommend using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). I also decided to give Kotlin a go. It has tons of neat features, null safety being the main reason for trying it out. If you'd like, you can check out Kotlin here: [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/?fromMenu)

#### I'd recommend using the 32-bit version of the JDK if you can, it has advantages over the 64-bit in terms of memory usage. JDK Download Link: [Java JDK 8 - Windows, Mac, and Linux](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)

### Closing Comments
Thank you for checking out my work/experiment! I'll be pushing updates to this project as often as I can. Please feel free to fork or port this to other languages! Have fun and keep on creating!
